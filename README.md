# Testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis as Applied to Bitcoin by Designing a Double Deep Q-Learning Trading Agent

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) stipulates that asset prices reflect all available information and a direct implication of this is that it is impossible to beat the market consistently on a risk-adjusted basis. Weak forms of the EMH are more likely to hold true in well established markets, such as S&P 500 stocks and major currency pairs, where sophisticated institutional investors dominate the majority of market volume. However, in more nascent and retail driven markets, such as crypto currencies, even weaker forms of the EMH may not hold, as retail market participants are more inclined to commit classical behavioural biases in their trading activity. Of course, an algorithmic trading agent does not suffer from such biases and thus leaves the possibility of overperforming in these retail investor driven markets. By building a Double Deep Q-learning trading agent in the BTC/USD market, and investigating if consistently over-performing the market is possible, we explore whether the EMH holds for this largely retail investor driven market. Our trading agent is shown to improve it's average performance with increased training episodes and reaches Net Asset Value returns close to the buy-and-hold strategy during training. When testing the agent, we find that the optimal strategy implemented by the agent is indeed the buy-and-hold strategy and therefore, our analysis does not demonstrate evidence against the EMH.
